# Exercise Reinforcement Learning
This exercise explores neural and table-based Reinforcement Learning.

- Table based RL:
    - `src/train_table_Q_frozen_lake.py`
    - `src/train_table_Q_tictactoe.py`
        - Finish the `TicTacToeBoard` class in `gen.py`.
- Neural RL:
    - `src/train_neural_Q_tictactoe.py`

`play.py` allows playng against the trained TicTacToe agents.
